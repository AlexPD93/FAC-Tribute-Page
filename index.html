      <p>
        Lionel Andrés Messi, also known as Leo Messi, (born 24 June 1987) is an
        Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains
        both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often
        considered as the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of
        the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or
        awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the
        Ballon d'Or Dream Team. He has spent his entire professional career with
        Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La
        Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues.
        A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records
        for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season
        (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8),
        and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga and European league season
        (21)(11) and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 750 senior career
        goals for club and country, and has the most goals ever by a player for
        a single club.

      <p>
        Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than
        taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change
        direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the
        Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite
        being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body
        strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting
        balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he
        has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with
        playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of
        acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the
        ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola
        once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball
        than he does without it." Although he has improved his ability with his
        weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed
        player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling
        runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes
        and assists.

        A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning,
        quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the
        defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his
        vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a conjurer,
        creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover,
        he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. With his conversion
        rate from his bending free kicks increasing over time Messi has
        developed into one of the best free kick exponents in the world. He also
        has a penchant for scoring from chips.

      <h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a
        fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years
        old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia,
        who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private
        for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in
        January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in
        Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.
