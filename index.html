      <h3>Overview</h3>
      Lionel Andrés Messi, also known as Leo Messi, (born 24 June 1987) is an
      Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both
      Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered
      as the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest
      players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, a
      record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or
      Dream Team. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona,
      where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles,
      seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific
      goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals
      in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most
      hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most
      assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga and European league season (21)(11)
      and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 750 senior career goals for
      club and country, and has the most goals ever by a player for a single
      club.

    <h2>Style of play</h2>
    <div>
      Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller
      players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction
      more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to
      dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite being physically
      unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined
      with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in
      withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been
      noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short,
      strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his
      quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at
      speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is
      the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."
      Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his
      mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of
      his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside
      of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.

      A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning,
      quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive
      line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and
      range of passing. He has often been described as a conjurer, creating
      goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an
      accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. With his conversion rate from
      his bending free kicks increasing over time Messi has developed into one
      of the best free kick exponents in the world. He also has a penchant for
      scoring from chips.

      <h2>Personal life</h2>
      Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a
      fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years
      old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who
      is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a
      year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009,
      before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the
      Barcelona–Espanyol derby.
